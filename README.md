What’s a command interpreter?
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object

Example:

import cmd

class HelloWorld(cmd.Cmd):
    """Simple command processor example."""
    
    def do_greet(self, line):
        print "hello"
    
    def do_EOF(self, line):
        return True

if __name__ == '__main__':
    HelloWorld().cmdloop()

By running in interactively:

$ python cmd_simple.py
(Cmd)
